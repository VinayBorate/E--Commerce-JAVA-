# Ecommerce Shop

Ecommerce Shop is an online vegetable shopping platform that connects customers, vendors, and administrators. Customers can browse, purchase, and manage their orders, while vendors can manage inventory and process orders. The platform is designed to provide a seamless, user-friendly shopping experience with advanced security features.

## 1) Project Description

Ecommerce Shop is an online vegetable shop designed to offer a seamless shopping experience for both customers and vendors. The increasing demand for convenient, accessible, and digital shopping platforms has led to the development of this project, which aims to create a streamlined system for purchasing fresh vegetables from multiple vendors in one place.

The platform connects three main user types: Customers, Vendors, and Admin. Customers can browse a wide selection of vegetables, compare prices, add items to their cart, and place orders. The system also allows them to track their orders and sort products by various criteria such as price, vendor, and vegetable categories (e.g., Seasonal, Root).

Vendors benefit from the ability to manage their vegetable inventory in real-time, adding, updating, or deleting items as needed. They can also review and respond to customer orders, either approving or rejecting them based on stock availability and other factors.

The Admin has overarching control, overseeing user activity and ensuring smooth platform operation. This includes approving or rejecting new users, removing users when necessary, and keeping track of the platform's overall revenue.

## 5) Technology Used

- **Java Advanced Technology**: J2EE (JSP, Servlets, JSTL)
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Font Awesome
- **Database**: SQL (DBMS)
- **Security**: RSA Algorithm (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
- **Server for Deployment**: Apache Tomcat

---

## 6) Model

The system follows a structured model with three main user roles:

- **Admin**: Full control over the platform and users.
- **Vendors**: Manage vegetable inventory, approve/reject customer orders, track order history.
- **Customers**: Browse vegetable listings, view order history, manage cart and checkout process.

The system uses a **one-to-many** relationship model where:
- One admin manages multiple vendors and customers.
- Each vendor serves multiple customers.

## 7) Security

### RSA Encryption:

Security is a top priority in the Ecommerce Shop platform. To ensure secure login and registration processes, we have implemented RSA encryption for both authentication and authorization. Here's how the encryption works:

- **Encryption Mechanism**: 
  - The client encrypts sensitive information (username, password, email) using a public key.
  - The encrypted information is transmitted securely, preventing plain text transmission over the network.

- **Decryption Process**: 
  - The server holds a private key that decrypts the data, ensuring only the server can access the original credentials.

- **Database Security**: 
  - All sensitive data is stored in an encrypted format in the database.
  - During login, the server decrypts the data and verifies it against user input.

- **Enhanced Security Features**: 
  - The client only has access to the public key, ensuring that they cannot decrypt sensitive information.
  - The encrypted text changes with each login attempt, adding another layer of protection.

This encryption model protects users' sensitive data, even if the database is compromised.
